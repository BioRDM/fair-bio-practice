## Why do we need to keep good quality records?
Good scientific practice includes good record keeping, which ensures not only transparency and reproducibility, but also accountability. One prime example of why this is necessary is the recent data scandal surrounding [Novartis' FDA approved gene therapy](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/novartis-gene-therapy-application-contained-manipulated-data-fda-says/560346/) Zolgensma, for the fatal childhood motor neuron disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (the most expensive treatment ever approved).
Novartis submitted manipulated data, showing that the comparison of two versions of Zolgensma in Phase 1 and Phase 3 testing had similar therapeutic activity. 
How can we prevent the occurrence of data manipulation such as this in the future, or how can we as a research community implement practices to make it easier to find manipulated records? FAIR record keeping, for example version control can help, as it shows what changes have been made when in electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs), which will make it difficult to manipulate results such as this without leaving a trace.

In order to avoid data mismanagement and such unexplained discrepancies, it is imperative to keep dated, accurate, complete and intelligible records of our experiments and the protocols we use. This means they should include enough detail for others to reproduce under ideally the same conditions. You are, legally (!!) the one responsible for your records, not your colleague, or your PI.

>## What designates a good record?
>Common guidelines of good record keeping for protocols and laboratory notebooks are the following:

Before we start this session on good record keeping, it might be a good idea to make ourselves cup of tea. Here's a peer-reviewed protocol for making tea:
<img src="../fig/06-handwritten-tea-protocol.jpg" alt="handwritten-tea-protocol" width="600"/>

## Differences between analog and digital record keeping
How did you find making your cup of tea from the above protocol?
As you could see, one scientist put milk in before boiling water, another one put boiling water in before milk. Another couldn't find which type of milk was used. Whilst the steps can be followed to produce a cup of tea, the teas can vary wildly. Slight variations are acceptable, but such as in an experiment, it is *more important that steps can be repeated correctly* so that others can do the same. 

Here is the same protocol typed out on [protocol.io](https://www.protocols.io/private/606E0A61A68011EBB6890A58A9FEAC02). Which might you find easier to follow?
> ## Task 
> What are advantages and disadvantages of traditional lab book-based record keeping vs. digital-based record keeping? Try to find at least a handful of advantages and disadvantages for each. With all of these, which system do you think is most advantageous?
>> ## Solution
>> **Advantages of traditional analog record keeping**
>> * Ability to directly draw on your records
>> * works regardless of internet/power access
>>
>> **Disadvantages of traditional analog record keeping**
>> * can be lost and/or damaged
>> * only in one location at any time 
>> * handwriting can make it less intelligible
>> * harder to edit/move elements around smoothly
>> * can’t store most data types (e.g. imaging data) in a useable way
>>
>> **Advantages of digital record keeping**
>> * can smoothly and easily move elements around to edit it
>> * can be shared instantly anywhere around the world, with anyone 
>> * can be easily commented on by anyone anywhere
>> * doesn’t take up physical space (no record rooms/folders)
>> * regular backups mean it won't be lost
>> * version controls mean changes can easily be tracked 
>> * can store protocols directly with other supporting data types (e.g. video explanations)
>> * can you think of more? 
>>
>> **Disadvantages of digital record keeping**
>> * dependent on internet access and power
>> * some digital record keeping services charge a fee
>> * risk of corruption if data is not backed up (either yourself or by the service used)

## Electronic Protocols
Here we want to demonstrate how to keep good quality records, and benefits that new repositories such as electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) or online protocols have. There are multiple repo's for ELNs and online protocols. We will discuss two free options that are easy to use: [Benchling](https://www.benchling.com/) and [procols.io](https://www.protocols.io/welcome) 
If you have not created accounts yet for both of them, please do so now as you will need them for the following exercises.

> ## Adapt protocols on protocols.io and export them
> To copy protocols from protocols.io, edit them and export them as .pdf there is a few simple steps to follow. We will be using the [making a cup of tea protocol](https://www.protocols.io/private/606E0A61A68011EBB6890A58A9FEAC02).
> ~~~
> # Fork the protocol, preserving the original for crediting
> 1. Open the link to the above protocol
> 2. Click on the downwards arrow next to the title
> 3. Select 'Copy/Fork' and click 'make a fork'
> 4. Select the Folder you want the protocol to be forked to and click 'continue'
> 5. Your fork of "How to make the perfect cup of tea" is ready now, click 'edit new fork'
>
> # Edit the forked protocol
> 1. Go to 'Materials' in the top tool-bar: add or edit materials according to your preferences, e.g. change full-fat milk to oat-milk, or add honey, lemon etc
> 2. Go to 'Steps' in the top tool-bar: edit the protocol according to your preferences
> 3. You can edit the 'Description' and 'Guidelines & Warnings' if you would like to
>
> # Export the forked protocol
> 1. Click 'More' in the top tool-bar, select 'Export' > 'PDF' > 'To your computer' and click export (leave selections blank)

## Electronic Lab Notebooks
By now you should be familiar with the concept of why digital record keeping is important, as this is ultimately more reproducible. It is self-explanatory that handwritten notes and laboratory notebook entries take more time to search when looking for an entry. Electronic lab notebooks allow organisation by project, and the search function, or filters, can quickly find what we are looking for.

> ## Create a lab-project on Benchling and import protocols
> To highlight how easy it is to share protocols across different platforms, integrate these into electronic lab notebooks, and export these for e.g. printing we will be looking at the following [Benchling project](https://benchling.com/iboehm/f_/KkCyJWRM-breakfast/).
> ~~~
> # Create a new project in Benchling and import protocols
> 1. Click the big '+' (Create Project) right next to Projects in your Benchling workspace
> 2. Call the project 'Breakfast', and add an appropriate description, click 'Create project'
> 3. Click on the above 'Benchling project' link bringing you to the public Project 'Breakfast'
> 4. If you see a side bar with the protocols 'Hollandaise Sauce' etc..., click the arrow pointing right at the top to expand the folder
> 5. Select the protocols: Hollandaise Sauce, Poached Egg, Portobello Mushrooms and Spinach
> 6. Press 'Copy to' in the top right tool bar and select the 'Breakfast' project to copy them to
> 7. Refresh your 'Breakfast' project, the protocols will now show up
> 8. Rename the protocols (right click 'rename') and remove 'Copy of'

> ## Create a lab-entry in Benchling, import a protocol from protocols.io
> You now know how to import protocols from other public Benchling users. We will now show you how to create a lab-entry on Benchling and import the Tea protocol from protocols.io.
> ~~~
> # Create a lab-entry in Benchling with multiple protocols
> 1. Click the big '+' right next to Projects/Breakfast in your Benchling workspace, select 'Entry' > 'Blank entry'
> 2. Under 'Notes' replace 'Untitled' with "Eggs Florentine in Portobello Mushrooms"
> 3. Click 'Add protocol', you can now Search your protocols that you would like to add/use in this lab entry. Select the following order: Portobello Mushrooms, Spinach, Poached egg, Hollandaise sauce
> 4. To import the protocol you exported from protocols.io, select 'Import from File', drag and drop the file or choose the file from your file manager, click 'Import'
> 5. Rename the cup of tea protocol under 'Name:' and call it cup of tea

> ## Clone existing lab-entries, change them and export lab entries
> You have now learned how to add protocols to a lab entry. To demonstrate how reproducible electronic lab notebooks are you will now clone our already written out lab entry for [Eggs Florentine in Portobello Mushrooms](https://benchling.com/s/etr-SY8fi7L8ZIDSMCLCf92o) and export it as a .pdf so you can print it and keep it at hand in the lab, or in this case the kitchen
> ~~~
> # Clone existing lab-entries and change them
> 1. Click the above link to the entry of 'Eggs Florentine in Portobello Mushrooms'
> 2. Select the clock symbol on the right hand side underneath Share and click 'Clone from Version'
> 3. Select the 'Breakfast' folder to clone it to
> 4. Make appropriate changes, such as move 'How to make tea' before 'portobello mushrooms' in the top bar, change this also in the Methods sections
>
> # Export lab entries
> 1. Click the info icon on the right hand side underneath the clock symbol you used previously and select 'Export entry'
> 2. Your export is now running, you will receive an email when the export is complete
