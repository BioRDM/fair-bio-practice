Show a notebook (with nice descriptions cells) which:
- (if possible to get a sensible library/program) 
calls a code from command line to do some simple file processing
(maybe one step from workflows workshop) 
that should show that it can replace commands lines while showing how exactly the programs/library well called
- reads in the results or excell files (in python)
- plots something from the results
- saves the figure to a file

- ask to run it
- ask to add some description (non coding cell)
- ask to change input file to another one and re-analysed it
