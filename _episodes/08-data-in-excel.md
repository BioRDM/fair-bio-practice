As in objectives, 
?maybe mention adding PIDs where possible, or discuss how to future proof your data
for example have a tab in which shortcuts for strains or conditions are explained
then they could be also enriched with PID rather than use PIDs through out documents
as those are prone to human errors unlike labels which are easy to spot or correct?
