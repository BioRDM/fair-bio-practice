title: "It is about planning"
teaching: 14
exercises: 16
questions:
- "What is the research data life cycle?"
- "Can planning help me manage my data and make it FAIR?"
- "What is a Data Management Plan (DMP)?"
objectives:
- "Learn that planing makes it easier to make your data FAIR."
- "Differentiate the different stages/steps of the data life cycle."
- "Learn how these steps will allow your data to become FAIR."
- "Write a sample DMP for your project."
keypoints:
- "Data within a project go through a set of steps known as the research data life cycle."
- "Planning can help make your data FAIR."
- "Data management is a continuous process and should not be done only at the end of a project."
- "DMPs are a good way to plan ahead and be ready for to manage your data once the project starts."

## The research data life cycle
The Research Data Life Cycle is composed of a sequential series of stages/steps in which data is produced,
processed and shared.
The arrows between circles represent the transitions that occur in research
as work is finished and passed to the next stage/step.
The re-use is the driving force of the cycle, cause as if you (or others) were
not going to use the data you would not need to store it or even process it.

## Data management is a continuous process
Data management should be done throughout the duration of your project.
If you wait till the end, it will take a massive effort on your side and will be more of a burden than a benefit.

There are many actions/steps which you can take during your research workflow
which would make it easier to share your data in a FAIR way, while, helping
you in your day to day activities.

> ## Challenge (4 + 4 minutes)
> Where would you say the following actions belong in the Research Data Life Cycle?
> How do they help in achieving FAIR principles?
>
> * clarify usage rights
> * give credit through citations
> * use open source software
> * attach PID to your data
> * attach descriptive metadata
> * produce standard metadata
> * backup your data
> * organize your files in folders
> * select data repository
> * add open licence
> * link publications, data and methods
> * create a template for assay description
> * use institutional repositories
> * use controlled vocabularies
> * convert numerical data to csv
> * track versions of files
> * performing statistical analysis
> * deposit datasets to Zenodo/Dryad
> * record experiment details in Electronic Lab Notebook
> * use github for your code
> * ask someone to revise your project structure
> * reformat and clean data tables
> * use a Minimal Information Standard
> * use PID in data description
> * download a dataset
> * link to UniProt or GenBank records
>
> > ## Solution
> > Actually many of the above steps can be taken throughout the data life cycle.

> ## Challenge (2 minutes)
> In pairs, discuss how this process may help in making your data FAIR:
> - How does it help in making it Findable?
> - How does it help in making it Accessible?
> - How does it help in making it Interoperable?
> - How does it help in making it Re-usable?

## Plan ahead: data management plans (DMPs)
A Data Management Plan is about PLANning! Funders are increasingly requiring that you present a DMP together with your grant applications. Some grad schools are also asking their
PhD students to prepair a DMP for their PhD project.

The DMP's purpose is to make you think about your data before you produce it. It must show that you were thinking about what will happen with your data during and after the project.
You should think about:
- how you will store the data
- how you will organize and describe your data
- how you will grant access to your data
- how you will share your data
- how you will preserve your data
- how much it will all cost

> ## Challenge (2 minutes)
> In pairs, discuss how writing a DMP would help planning how to make your data FAIR.
{: .challenge}

The benefits of writing a DMP include:
- finding and understanding your data when needed
- avoiding unnecessary duplication of data
- documenting your data to ensure ongoing access and continuity when you or other colleagues depart or new reseach staff start
- validating your published results
- ensuring your research is visible and has impact
- getting credit when others cite your work
- sharing your data, leading to collaboration and advances in research
- complying with research funder mandates

> ## Challenge (10 minutes)
> Working in pairs, write a short DMP for one of your last papers (or projects).
> Your DMP should contain the following three sections:
>
> 1. What type of data you will acquire during the research
> Please describe the type of data you will generate (for example ‘flow cytometry data’) as well as the type of files these data will be stored under (include the meta data as well). Estimate the size of your data.
>
> 2. How you will store the date
> Please describe how you will store/organize or document the data during the duration of the project
>
> 3. How you will share the data
> Please describe the strategies for data sharing, licensing and access information.

> ## DMP Online
> [DMP Online](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) is a UK tool that is available via subscription to many UK Universities and Institutions. It contains DMP templates
> for the different funders requirements and information on how to fill each section. Whenever you need to write your next DMP, it is highly available to check
> if this resource is available to you.
> Additionally, many Universities may offer help and advise for your DMP. For example, [the BioRDM Team](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/RDMS/Research+Data+Management+SynthSys+%28f1sysrdm%29+Home)
> of the School of Biological Sciences of The University of Edinburgh offers free advice on how to write a DMP to UoE researchers.
