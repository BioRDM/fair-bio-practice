Excersize 1.
The general repository.

Have a look at the following Zenodo record X, what elements make it FAIR.

Excersize 2.
Can you easily find similar data sets in Zenodo?

Expected conclussion: Zenodo is a good place to keep your data separate from paper, give access to all files, beining
able to cite the data rather than paper. 
But it is not good for disovery, and does not enforces any metadata.

Excersize 3. 
Select one of the following repositories based on your expertize/interests.

Have a look at the record X in the repor R1 (data type D1, domain D1)
Have a look at the record Y in the repor R2 (data type D2, domain D2)
Have a look at the record Z in the repor R3 (data type D3, domain D3)
Have a look at the record W in the repor R4 (data type D4, domain D3)

Report to the group, what advantages can you see in using the repo over a general repo like Zenodo.

Finding a repository:
- check the publishers / funders list (give the links)
- Fairsharing

Vetting repositories by what.

Excercize 4
a) Find a repo for data Z.
Z is in the Wellcome or publisher list ... easy.

b) Z is not on the list, 
Fairsharing gives few options, people may give different answer follow up why they selected particular ones.


Excersize 5
Wrap up discussion, 
Why using domain specific repo over zenodo is more FAIR?
How selecting a repo for your data as soon as you do experiment can benefit you research and being FAIR?


The END






Show domain specific vs general 
(e.g. this omero based showcase datasets vs images in zenodo/fig share)
(or biodare vs zenodo/fig)
Both have problem that not having dois, or maybe the omero one has.
Faridom hub vs zenodo. Fairdom hub can run model simulations! And has project structures
maybe good to show

Recommend the most obvious repos.

Teach how to find a repo, that best way is to start with lists from publishers and funders,

Fairsharing, shows toooooo many. How to choose then, what criteria to use (standards, funding)

Finding repo first may help in deciding what metdata to collect and how.
