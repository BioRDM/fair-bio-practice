## Project organization: planning file names and folders structure

Before you even start collecting or working with data, you should decide how you will structure and name files and folders. This will:
* allow for standardized data collecting and analysis by many team members.
* make it easier for the researcher to determine where files should be saved.
* avoid file duplication.
* help to make retrieval and archiving more efficient.

Consistent naming and organizing files in folders has two main goals:
* quick finding needed files
* being able to tell the file content without opening it

## Naming your files (and folders)
One important and often overlooked aspect of organizing, sharing, and keeping track of data
files is standardising naming.  
It is important to develop naming conventions
which permits encoding experimental factors which are important to the project.

File (folder) names should be consistent, meaningful to you and your collaborators,
allow you to easily find what you are looking for,
give you a sense of the content without opening the file,
and identify if something is missing.

Some things to take into account to decide on your naming convention are:

- Does your convention make your files easy to sort
and find by the most important feature?
	- include any parameter that helps the name being as descriptive as
	possible (i.e.: project, experiment, researcher, sample, organism,
	date (range), data type, method)
    - defined a standard vocabulary (shortcuts) for parameters
	- decide which elements go in which order.

- Decide the convention when to use symbols, capitals, hyphens
(e.g kebab-case, CamelCase, or snake_case).

- Defined a maximum name length.
Aim for filenames no longer than ~30 characters.

- Document any abbreviation of your parameters.

**Do's:**
- for dates use the YYYY-MM-DD standard and place at the end of the file UNLESS you need to organise your files chronologically
- include version number (if applicable), use leading zeroes (i.e.: v005 instead of v5).
- make sure the 3-letter file format extension is present at the end of the name (e.g. .doc, .xls, .mov, .tif)
- add a **PROJECT_STRUCTURE** (README) file in your top directory which details your naming convention, directory structure and abbreviations

**Don'ts:**
- avoid using spaces (use _ or - instead)
- avoid dots, commas and special characters (e.g. ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ` ; < > ? , [ ] { } ‘ “)
- avoid using language specific characters (e.g óężé), unfortunately
they still cause problems with may software or between operating systems (OS)
- avoid long names
- avoid repetition, e.g if directory name is *Electron_Microscopy_Images*,
  and file *ELN_MI_IMG_20200101.img* then ELN_MI_IMG is redundant
- avoid deep paths with long names (i.e. deeply nested folders with long names)
as archiving or moving between OS may fail


If adding all the relevant details to file names makes them too long,
it is often a signal that you should use folder to organize the files and
capture some of those parameters.

## Strategies to set up a clear folder structure
Establishing a system that allows you to access your files,
avoid duplication and ensure that your data can be easily found
needs planning.

You can start by developing a logical folder structure. To do so, you need to take into account the following suggestions:

- Use folders to group related files. A single folder will make it easy to locate them.
- Name folders appropriately: use descriptive names after the areas of work to which they relate.
- Structure folders hierarchically: use broader topics for your main folders and increase in specificity as you go down the hierarchy.
- Be consistent: agree on a naming convention from the outset of your research project.

> The [Good enough practices in scientific computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510#sec009) paper makes the following simple recommendations:
> * Put each project in its own directory, which is named after the project
> * Put text documents associated with the project in the 'doc' directory
> * Put raw data and metadata in a 'data' directory
> * Put files generated during cleanup and analysis in a 'results' directory
> * Put project source code in the 'src' directory
> * Put compiled programs in the 'bin' directory
> * Name all files to reflect their content or function:
>   - Use names such as 'bird_count_table.csv', 'notebook.md', or 'summarized_results.csv'.
>   - Do not use sequential numbers (e.g., result1.csv, result2.csv) or a location in a final manuscript (e.g., fig_3_a.png), since those numbers will almost certainly change as the project evolves.

## Backing up your project files and folders
* Back up (almost) everything created by a human being or recorded by a machine
as soon as it is created.
* Always backup your files in 3 places, at least one should be off-site.
* USB sticks are a failure-prone option and are not valid solution for backup of
scientific data
* A robust backup cannot be achieved manually

Do you know how and where to keep 3 copies of your data
which are always up to date?

Secure data preservation is very difficult to achieve without institutional support
and know-how. One option is a cloud storage, but not all data
may not be put in a public cloud.

You should always check your institutional guidelines
and what solutions are available in your organization.

Have you realised that the following the above suggestions means
including valuable metadata as part of your folder structure
and file names?
