The course is aimed at non-PI researchers in biomedicine science (PhD students, postdocs, technicians, etc.) who are interested in Open Science, FAIR principles and data management. This training is aimed at those who want to be familiar with these concepts and apply them throughout their projectâ€™s life cycle. 

## Introduction
FIXME Open Science is disruptive. It will change how we do reasearch and how society benefits from it. Making data re-usable is key to this, and FAIR principles are a way: to achieve it.
* But what does it mean in practice?
* How can a biologist incorporate those principles in their workflow?
* We will learn that becoming FAIR and following OS practices is a process.

We will teach you how planning and using the correct set of tools you can make your outputs ready for public sharing and reuse. 

This hands-on 4-sessions workshop covers the basics of Open Science and FAIR practices,
and looks at how to use these ideas in your own projects. The workshop is a mix of lectures
and hands-on lessons where you will use the approaches learned and implement some of the discussed practices. 

## Target Audience

PhD students, postdocs, technicians who actively generate or analyse biological data, in majority bench biologists. 
This course can also be interesting to modellers, data analysts, project managers and advocates of FAIR/Open Data.

Shania T. Wain (she/her) - junior postdoc  
Shania is starting her first postdoctoral stay. She has recently obtained a PhD in Plant Biology and is very skilled in running plant molecular and physiology experiments. She recently published her first publication, but found the process of preparing all the figures and required information for the publisher as super tedious and time consuming. As a postdoc, she must find an effective way to organise her own research project and the PhD students she is going to supervise...([read more](./learners) ) 
  
  
> ## Prerequisites
>
> You don't need to have prior knowledge of data managemet or programming skills but you need to be willing to learn how to apply FAIR principles
> in your daily research life.
> 
> We expect you to:
> * have a bio/medical background
> * know basics of scientific communication, publications, citations and their importance for careers
> * familiarity with spreadsheets (XL)
> * familiarity with online bioscience data resources (in general, not any particular resource); for example: searching publications
> * know your ways around files and directories on your own machine 
> 
> There may be additional prerequisites for individual episodes/lessons in the extras section.

> Senior PIs running their groups rather than performing experiments should come to FIXME COURSE. 
> Bioinformaticians and those who mostly develop scientific software may prefer software specific courses like FIXME FIXME.  
  
  
> ## Learning Objectives
>
> After following this lesson, learners will be able to:
>
> * explain the elements Open Science movement. 
> * explain the FAIR principles and understand their importance. 
> * plan their own data managment strategy.
> * prepare their data for re-use.
> * aply aproaches and tools into FAIR-ready research data cycle.
> * find suitable resources for delivering Open Science and FAIR data
