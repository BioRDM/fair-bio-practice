[Instructions in this document are in between brackets.]
[This template has been designed with the goal of documenting datasets that are made publicly available in a repository, but it can be adapted to working datasets.]
[Dates in this document should use the format YYYY-MM-DD.]
[Scholarly outputs cited in this document should follow a consistent style (e.g. APA style)]
[When you are done filling this template delete all instructions and delete any sections or questions that do not apply to your dataset.]
[All of the items in this template are optional, but fill it as thoroughly as possible to ensure the reusability of your dataset.]
[You may create more than one readme file in your dataset, if appropriate (e.g. one for your tabular data, one for your code)]
[This template was created by the BioRDM Team of the University of Edinburgh (UK) by modifying the readme template from the Research Data Services at Oregon State University, which can be found at https://guides.library.oregonstate.edu/ld.php?content_id=45294345. This template was in turn generated by modifying and expanding the University of Minnesota Libraries readme template that can be found in z.umn.edu/readme]

------------------------------------

GENERAL INFORMATION [What?]
Abstract
[The abstract should describe the research / biological aspect to which the dataset relates.]

CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION [What?]
Dataset description
[The abstract should describe the dataset, not the research or the results obtained after analyzing the dataset. The dataset abstract should be different than an article or book abstract, even if the dataset is tightly related to the article or book.]

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION [What?]
[Describe the methodology used to generate the dataset]
[Include links or references to publications or other documentation containing methodological information]
[Do not copy paste the methods section from a pending publication unless you have made sure that you can do that. Some journals may consider this as a publication, and will not accept a manuscript with a section that has already been published.]
[If you want to refer to an article that has not been accepted for publication yet, include as much information as you have at the moment (e.g. authors and title). If the publication has been published include the DOI in the citation. If the publication does not have a DOI (like a dissertation) include a URL.]

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
[experimental design or protocols used in data collection]

DATASET FOLDER/FILE OVERVIEW [Where?]
[All folders/files in the dataset should be listed here. If a file naming schema is used, it is fine to explain it instead of listing all the files. Include directory structure if necessary.]
[Filenames should include extension.]

1. Datasets List
   A. ['.zip' filename] [Short description]        

2. Relationship between folders/files:

3. Formats
[List all the formats present in this dataset. Include explanations or instructions if necessary (e.g. links to page describing a metadata standard)]        

DATA REUSE [Why?]
[Describe for whom the datasets might be of interest]

OTHER 
[Include any other important information about the data that you did not have opportunity to discuss anywhere in this template]
